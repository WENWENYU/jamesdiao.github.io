#### Simple solution
After 3 minutes, the 1 amoeba in the first jar will double to 2 amoeba, just like the initial second jar. Thus, the second jar is equivalent to the first jar, but fast-forwarded by 3 minutes. The first jar took 1 hour to fill up, and the second jar should fill up 3 minutes faster. The answer is **57 minutes**. 

#### A more detailed explanation
The number of amoeba in each jar follows the trend: 

| Time (min)        | 0 | 3 | 6 | 9  | 12 |
|-------------------|---|---|---|----|----|
| # Amoeba in Jar 1 | 1 | 2 | 4 | 8  | 16 |
| # Amoeba in Jar 2 | 2 | 4 | 8 | 16 | 32 |

Algebraically, the number of amoeba at time t (in minutes) can be expressed as $2^{t/3}$ in jar 1 and $2^{t/3 + 1}$ in jar 2.  
We are asked to find t such that the number of amoeba in jar 2 is equal to the number in jar 1 after an hour.  
This gives us the equation $2^{t/3 + 1} = 2^{60/3}$, which is quite straightforward to solve.  
$$2^{t/3 + 1} = 2^{60/3}$$
$$t/3 + 1 = 60/3$$
$$t + 3 = 60$$
$$t = 57$$
