People sometimes ask for advice before applying to college. Instead of typing out a monologue each time, I put together a document of things I learned from the process. Now that my brother is planning to go through the whole process soon, I thought I'd revisit everything. 

### Selecting Schools
1.	Find a good spread. I had two safety schools, a ton of more-or-less match schools, and five reach schools. I think it's a good idea to stack match schools because even in the worst case scenario, you'll still probably get into a few of them. 
2.	Apply to a lot of places (but only places you would be happy going to). This is the advice I was given and it made sense to me. You've already done most of it -- good grades, SAT scores, volunteering, extracurriculars, and CommonApp -- the only new thing is the supplement.  It doesn't have to be super good either; luck is a huge part of decisions, and you might as well get it out there. ~$70 for each new app is hefty, but it's nothing compared to tuition, and probably worth the safety net. But remember, each new app trades off with apps you care more about.
3.	Don't limit yourself by fixating on a dream school. Reputation and gut feeling rarely reflect the reality of being a student, and they might keep you from seeing the amazing side of some other cool places. 
4.	Don't overlook liberal arts schools. They have great teaching and grad/professional school placement. However, remember that they're also quite small, which restricts extracurricular and research opportunities. 

### On Applying Early
1.	If you're a procrastinator like me, it forces you to get your life together. It pressures you to find recommenders, write that CommonApp, and start thinking about what you want to get across in your apps.
2.	It (probably) gives you a (small) advantage. Schools really like keeping their yield high, and they like kids who've identified them as their first choice. This is especially true of binding early decision programs, but (a) you can't back out for any reason, and (b) you must be prepared to pay tuition in full (the acceptance is binding regardless of whether you like your financial aid). 
3.	Be wary of applying early to your top choice school unless you're certain it is the best possible application you can send out. You lose two whole months of essay revision, which is a huge deal. You also lose out on two months of senior year accomplishments that could help your application. 

### Writing Advice

1.	Good writing is in the details--be vivid and specific. 
2.	Spend some time really digging for who you are and what matters to you. Don't settle for "I love X." Why do you love X? What do you love about it? Why does it complete you? Find it and find a memorable way to express it. 
3.	The biggest technical mistakes are addressed by George Orwell. I am very fond of these.  
a.	Never use a metaphor, simile, or figure of speech you've seen before.  
b.	Never use a long word where a short word will do.  
c.	If it is possible to cut a word or sentence out (without changing the intent or meaning), always cut it out.  
d.	Always use the active form (He ate the chip > the chip was eaten by him).  
e.	Never use a foreign phrase, scientific word, or jargon if there's an everyday English equivalent.  
f.	Break any of these rules sooner than say something outright barbarous.  
4.	Essays almost always sound better in present tense. Unless you have multiple time frames or you're writing a reflective essay, try not to avoid using it. 
5.	Do not get lost in empty language/metaphors/creativity. The message of an essay is worth much more. It's okay to be fanciful, so long as it's there to enhance meaning.
6.	Write past the word limit, until there's absolutely nothing more you can write on the topic. Then condense, condense, condense. 
7.	If you get stuck, start working on another essay.  
8.	Try to avoid risky topics (like religion/politics) unless it's a huge part of the way you think/who you are. Be especially conservative on the CommonApp essay, because it goes to every single college.   
9.	Remember (and pity) your audience. Admissions officers are really tired and overworked and probably spend ~15 minutes on your entire file. Get the message across as cleanly as you can, and don't count on them picking up on subtleties. Also, remember that admissions officers are often young and fairly liberal.  
10.	Take extra care with your "Why [X]" essay. Brown won't accept a student that they think would get into and choose Harvard over them. Columbia seems to like highly diverse interests; MIT is known for a quirky/intellectual culture. Do your research -- find what kind of student they look for, and explain how you'd fit in.  
11.	Be very careful about recycling or adapting essays for prompts that are not more-or-less the exact same. They can sound clunky and forced to fit.  
12.	Start brainstorming and prewriting the summer before senior year. I got this advice from several different people and ignored it and regretted it horribly. 


### Recommendations
1.	Find someone who:
a.	Likes you and knows you well and genuinely cares (obviously).
b.	You've kept up with for a while and still keep up with.
c.	Does not write 30+ recs. It lends itself to generic and bland letters.
d.	Is timely. Trust me, you do not need the stress of waiting the weekend before the deadline, praying that (s)he doesn't forget or do a rush job. 
e.	Has something to write about! Being a good student is not good enough if all they can say is "smart kid, worked hard." 
2.	If you're asking a junior teacher, ask early in the year. Preferably the first two days. If you're asking a senior teacher, don't use them for the early round -- they almost certainly don't know you well enough and might not update for regular decision.
3.	Consider writing them a "self-evaluation," where you talk about some anecdotes or achievements that you're proud of. 


### Interviews
1.	General information: interviews are done by alumni, not the people evaluating your application. They get your contact info and either call or email you to schedule a time and place. Interviews typically last 30-60 minutes, and are usually quite casual. Some schools give 1-on-1 interviews, and some bring all their interviewers and interviewees to one place. 
2.	School specific: For Rice, you have to request an interview. For Duke, you need to submit 2 weeks early to guarantee getting an interview. Yale and Columbia rarely offer interviews here, so think about asking for one if/when you visit. 
3.	From my own experiences and all I've heard from admissions officers, these don't matter all that much. But take them seriously! A great interview might not be able to get you in, but a bad one can certainly keep you out. 
4.	Think hard about what you want them to know and remember to bring them up. 
5.	Do your research. Know exactly why you want to go there, what you're going to do with all their phenomenal resources, and what sets them apart. The last point is critical. When they ask you "Why ____", you should have a monologue ready. 
6.	If you can, talk to a current student about what they like and don't like about the place. 
7.	Have answers to all the standard questions. Just go to Google to find a good list and practice with it. 
8.	Another purpose of the interview is to get whatever your application didn't capture about you, so they'll probably ask something like, "is there anything else you'd like added to your file that you didn't get to talk about in your application or this interview?" Have something ready to bring up! 
9.	The interview is a two-way conversation, so use this time to learn more about the school--what they liked and didn't like, etc. Have at least 3 questions ready. 
10.	If they don't tell you how to dress, it's okay to ask. If you forgot to ask, it's better to overdress than to underdress. 
11.	Do not be less than 20 minutes early. This gives you some leeway for random delays and it also gives you time to save them a seat.  
12.	Bring a resume. Don't randomly offer it, but have it ready if they ask. These should be 1 page long (few high schoolers have done enough to justify more). 
13.	Send an email (or note) afterwards to thank them for their time. 
14.	Practice. 


### Additional Info
1.	The additional info section is there for anything that you weren't able to say in other parts of the application. They only give you like two lines on the extracurricular section; this is probably where you want to expand on them. How else are they going to know what you actually do? I used up ~400 words. 
2.	I found it easiest to describe my extracurriculars in the order: description, involvement, and achievements. Feel free to divvy them up between the extracurricular page and additional info section however you'd like.  
3.	Keep it short, simple, and conversational--not essay-style. But it's okay to have your voice come through. 
4.	There are colleges that allow you to attach a resume. On the one hand, a resume allows you to present your work in a clean and aesthetic way. On the other hand, a resume might look prepackaged and somewhat less genuine. Either way, the extracurricular and additional info sections should cover everything important. 
5.	You might also choose to include a short essay that you really like. This is only useful if it captures something about you that the prompts can't cover. 
6.	Speaking of the extracurricular page, don't put in anything you don't care about, and don't feel obligated to fill all 10 spaces. The fluff will only dilute your truly great achievements.
