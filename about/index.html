    <br> 
    <p> Hi! My name is James Diao. I'm currently a senior at Yale University
    studying Biochemistry and Statistics. I was interested in documenting my
    learning and interests throughout my education, and this is where I've
    decided to put it.</p>
    <br><br>
  </div>
  
  <p> I grew up in Sugar Land, Texas, a suburban outgrowth of Houston. I lived there for my first eighteen years, before coming to the Northeast for college. While in college, I took up Ballroom and Latin dance, which is basically how I spend all of my free time. I have also been able to explore my interest in the medicine: the scientific side through my classes and research, and the clinical side at Yale-New Haven Hospital and HAVEN Free Clinic. </p>
  <br>
  <p> My research work covers two distinct fields: molecular bioinformatics and clinical genetics. I have a few blurbs on my projects below, but please click on the links if you'd like more information. </p>
  <p> I joined the <a href="/archives/2017/08/22/gerstein-lab">Gerstein Lab</a> at Yale my freshman year, and I've been working on a few projects related to extracellular RNA. Somehow, these molecules just float around in extracellular fluids and are protected against degradation by RNAses. They carry information about the cells that they come from, which may be useful for the diagnosis and tracking of disease. Pretty cool huh? Anyway, my work has been on developing methods to (1) infer their tissues of origin, and (2) visually identify relationships between collection methods, locations, and biofluids. </p>
  <p> The next two summers, I worked in the <a href="/archives/2017/08/22/zak-lab">Kohane Lab</a> at the Harvard-MIT Summer Institute on clinical genetics. With the release of large and diverse control sequencing cohorts, we now have the data to study some important measures, such as the predictive capacity of a certain genetic test, or how ethnic populations might be affected differently. I've been working on these estimations and comparisons for the past year. </p>
  <p> Right now, I'm particularly excited about applications of deep learning to biomedical problems. Specifically, I was blown away by three papers that described super-human classification of disease states (e.g. diabetic retinopathy, skin cancers, and heart arrhythmias). It's an incredible feat, and I love how this kind of work has a direct and powerful link to actually improving care. I have little experience in this field, but I'm taking more classes in this area, and I recently started a project to estimate left ventricular measurements in cardiac MRIs. One day, if all goes well, I would love to contribute to similar advances.</p>
