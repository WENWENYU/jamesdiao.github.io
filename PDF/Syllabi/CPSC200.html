<h3>Course Description</h3>
<p>

Information technology is ubiquitous. This course focuses on the real
world artifacts and implementations that comprise the vital
computational organisms that populate our world. Topics include
hardware (computer architecture), software (programming languages,
databases, networking), and related issues such as security, and
software engineering. Examples stress practical applications of
technology. Homework assignments will generally involve programming in
Python.

It's easy to start writing code with Python: that's why the language
is so immensely popular. However, Python has unique strengths, charms,
and expressivity that can be hard to grasp at first -- as well as
hidden pitfalls that can easily trip you up if you aren't aware of
them. Effective Python will help you harness the full power of Python
to write exceptionally robust, efficient, maintainable, and
well-performing code. Utilizing the concise, scenario-driven style
pioneered in Scott Meyers's best-selling Effective C++, Brett Slatkin
brings together 59 Python best practices, tips, shortcuts, and
realistic code examples from expert programmers.

which permits and interactive exchange of questions and information:

Note: students are not allowed to post code to piazza.

<dt> Zoo accounts
<dd>The Zoo is a collection of computers located on the 3rd floor of
AKW at the front of the building.  
You will need a *course account* on the Zoo
to submit homework.
Sign up for a CS 200 course account on the Zoo using the
on-line signup procedure at <a href="http://zoo.cs.yale.edu/accounts.html">
<tt>http://zoo.cs.yale.edu/accounts.html</tt></a>.
There will be *help sessions* on using the Zoo early in the term.
A Zoo tutorial is available on-line
from the course web page.

<dt>Course directory
<dd>The course directory, <tt>/c/cs200</tt> is accessible from your Zoo
course account.  It contains copies of handouts.</dd>

<h3>Course Requirements</h3>

<p>
The course requirements consist of class attendance, 
(more-or-less) weekly programming
assignments in Python and occasional written homework,
and two EVENING MIDTERMS and a FINAL EXAM.
Plan on spending between 6-8 hours per
week on the course outside of class.  The programming
assignments are an integral part of the course.
</p>


<p> Please try not to leave the homework to the last minute.  You will
be more efficient, learn more, have more chance to get help, and generally
be calmer and happier if you do the associated reading first and
start the programming or other problems early.
</p>

<h3>Grading</h3>

<p>
The final grade in the course will be based on class participation, 
your performance on the
programming assignments and other homework, and the exams.
The weighting of these components will be approximately 40% on
homework and 60% on exams.
</p>

<h3>Late Policy</h3>

<p> 
Late work without a Dean's excuse 
will be assessed a penalty of 5 points per day, based on
the day and time recorded by the Zoo electronic submit program.
At the end of term, up to 25 points will be deducted from
the total lateness penalties your homework has accrued.
However, according to Yale College regulations,
*no* homework can be accepted after the end
of Reading Week without a Temporary Incomplete (TI) 
authorized by your dean.
</p>

<p>
If you have a Dean's excuse or a TI, making up missed work may involve
alternative assignments, at the discretion of the instructor;
please check with the instructor in this case.
</p>

<h3>Policy on Working Together</h3>

<p> Unless otherwise specified, the homework assignments are your
individual responsibility.  Plagiarism is a violation 
of University rules and will not be tolerated.  You must neither 
copy work from others (at Yale or elsewhere)
nor allow your own work to be copied.
You are definitely on the wrong side of the boundary
if you give or receive a printed or electronic copy of your
or anyone else's work for the course from this term or previous
terms.
</p>

<p> You are encouraged to ask others for help with the computers and Unix, 
with questions about Python, general questions about the concepts and
material of the course,
but if you need more extensive help with a program or other assignment, 
please ask a TA or the instructor for assistance.  Working in groups
to solve homework problems is not permitted in this course.  Please 
talk to the instructor if you have any questions about this policy.
