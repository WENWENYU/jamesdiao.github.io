Over the past few years, I've come to realize that many of my intuitions and beliefs about medicine and health care were flat-out wrong. In the spirit of transparency, I'm going to confess to all of my misconceptions and document them here. 

## 1. Medicine is based on rigorous scientific evidence
a. [PLOS Medicine](http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.0020124)
b. [The Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2017/02/when-evidence-says-no-but-doctors-say-yes/517368/)
c. [Nature 1](https://www.nature.com/news/cancer-reproducibility-project-releases-first-results-1.21304)
d. [Science 1](http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/06/cancer-studies-pass-reproducibility-test)
e. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replication_crisis)

## 2. Prevention decreases costs
a. [NYT](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/29/upshot/preventive-health-care-costs.html)
b. [NEJM](http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp0708558)
c. [AAFP](https://www.aafp.org/news/blogs/freshperspectives/entry/does_prevention_save_money_that.html). 

## 3. Technology decreases costs
a. [Hastings Center](https://www.thehastingscenter.org/briefingbook/health-care-costs-and-medical-technology/)
b. [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2017/10/26/technology-and-rising-health-care-costs/#d346a26766bc)
c. [CBO](https://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/110th-congress-2007-2008/reports/01-31-techhealth.pdf)

## 4. Older doctors are better than younger ones

b. [USA Today](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2017/05/18/nice-older-doctor-you-go-well-turns-out-you-might-live-longer-younger-one/101822418/)

## 5. Doctor shortages can be solved by training more doctors

b. [BMJ 2](http://www.bmj.com/content/359/bmj.j4528)

## 7. NGS is a magic bullet
a. "We biomedical scientists are addicted to data, like alcoholics are addicted to cheap booze. As in the old joke about the drunk looking under the lamppost for his lost wallet, biomedical scientists tend to look under the sequencing lamppost where the "light is brightest"â€”that is, where the most data can be obtained as quickly as possible. Like data junkies, we continue to look to genome sequencing when the really clinically useful information may lie someplace else."
