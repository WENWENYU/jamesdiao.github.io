### On Role Models, Overheard @ Yale
> Be the person the Asian tourists think you are. 


### On Income, Unknown
> But if you make twice as much money, your whole life is BOGO.  


### On Faith, Marcus Aurelius
> Live a good life.  
If there are Gods and they are just, then they will not care how devout you have been, but will welcome you based on the virtues you have lived by.  
If there are Gods, but unjust, then you should not want to worship them.  
If there are no Gods, then you will be gone, but will have lived a noble life that will live on in the memories of your loved ones.


### On Gratitude, Daniel Lev Shkolnik
> In times of doubt, despair, and sadness, when you’re worried about all the fun you’ll never have or all the lives you could be living, look over your shoulder. Hop back a step on the chain and long—with all your longing—to be you.  
Want your skin. Want your country. Want your accent. Want your food. Want your face. Want your health. Want your tech. Want your opportunities, whatever they may be. Want your luxury and your modesty. Want your weariness and your glee. Want your pains, your sacred pains. Your gasps and laughs and all those things.  
Look up enviously at yourself, living in your little heaven. Want with all your wanting, long with all your longing, need with all your needing, to rise up and be you. And suddenly, you are.


### Make the Ordinary Come Alive, William Martin
> Do not ask your children  
to strive for extraordinary lives.  
Such striving may seem admirable,  
but it is a way of foolishness.  
Help them instead to find the wonder   
and the marvel of an ordinary life.  
Show them the joy of tasting  
tomatoes, apples and pears.  
Show them how to cry  
when pets and people die.  
Show them the infinite pleasure  
in the touch of a hand.  
And make the ordinary come alive for them.  
The extraordinary will take care of itself.  


### Excerpt, The Survivor's Guide to Adulthood, Wyatt Hong 
> We have entered these fields wanting to change the world and have found that it is the world that changes us. Your liberal arts education will not fix the broken copier. We sit on the stairs wondering whether we will ever become the person we aspired to be. We learn that it will be decades until we climb to a position of power to make a sizable impact. You worry you may not have a soul by then...  
But something pricks me from inside. The question: will I ever change the world.  
I remember what I had aspired to be three years ago: a hero like Hercules or Prometheus. I’ve arrived now to the conclusion that I have neither superpowers nor a divine message. I am simply a passenger on this ship called Earth, as mortal as the 295 who died inside Ship Sewol...  
Tomorrow, you will dance away the spring. And next year, you will be sitting on a staircase wondering whether you will ever change the world. Do not despair. You are not expected to save humanity. Be kind. Be happy. That is all that is required of you. 


### A Mother's Day Message, Jane Kim
> 엄마, you're far from those perfect mothers I grew up hearing of. You have a bad temper and can be extremely stubborn. But despite this, you are the living embodiment of pure and sacrificial love. You overcompensate for what you can't give by cooking hearty meals with dozens of side dishes, handing us endless bowls of sliced fruit, and working extra-long hours at the store. But I pray that you know you're enough. You give of yourself so fully to the few you love, even when we often turn a blind eye to your selflessness. I wish you'd enjoy yourself more, take time to reconnect with old friends and meet new ones, or buy a pretty pair of shoes to show off and throw away those threadbare nikes.  
Thank you for your willingness to watch late night k-dramas with me even as you'd nod off within minutes. Thank you for warming my hands every winter night, enlacing the cold and soft within the worn and warm. Thank you for loving us; our family would not be a family without you. To my honest, beautiful mother- happy mother's day. See you soon.
