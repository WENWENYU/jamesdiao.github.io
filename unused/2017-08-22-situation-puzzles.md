\[POST IN PROGRESS\]

I love these games. In a "situation puzzle," an unknown situation is presented to a group of players, who must then try to figure out the details of the story by asking further questions. There is generally one question that the players aim to answer, or one "epiphany" that must be discovered. The person who initially presented the situation can only answer "yes" or "no" to questions (or occasionally "irrelevant").

I'll put together my own list soon, but for now, there's a great collection online here: [Jed's List of Situation Puzzles](http://www.kith.org/logos/things/sitpuz/situations.html).
