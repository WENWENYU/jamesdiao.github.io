Career Talk with Zak about Academia and Admissions

### Path to Academia

#### Grants
1. NSF Fellowship: 15% acceptance rate for first-time applicants, >50% acceptance rate for reapplicants.  
2. F32: standard merit grant. Individual funding for two years. Helps you get a postdoc because you come with your own salary.  
3. F99: extra merit grant. Six years of guaranteed funding, best award for prospective postdocs.  

#### Path
1. PhD Program: programs look for people who will "one day make them proud." Any evidence of this (especially writing and publishing a manuscript) is great. GPA is important but not dominant.  
2. Postdoc (2-4 years): most important decision. Reputation of your lab is critical. Be sure to negotiate which part of your project youc an take with you when you start your own lab.  
3. Assistant professor: selection by CV, statement, references, etc. Highly competitive.  
4. Tenured professor: may not exist in many medical schools. Promotions earned by demonstrated ability to achieve independent funding.
