This Spring, I applied to and joined the Yale Effective Altriusm Fellowship. I'll give more details later, but I just want to track what I learn throughout. 

## 1. Introduction to Effective Altriusm (2/7/2018)

### Topic
> Effective altruism is premised on the idea of 'doing good better', but why does this matter, and how far can this be taken? For the very first dinner, we will focus on the fundamentals of Effective Altruism â€“ why is the movement appealing and are there some ideas that it takes too far?
