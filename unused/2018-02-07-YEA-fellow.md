This Spring, I applied to and joined the Yale Effective Altriusm Fellowship. I'll give more details later, but I just want to use this post to keep track of what I learn throughout.

## 1. Introduction to Effective Altriusm (2/7/2018)

### Topic
> Effective altruism is premised on the idea of 'doing good better', but why does this matter, and how far can this be taken? For the very first dinner, we will focus on the fundamentals of Effective Altruism â€“ why is the movement appealing and are there some ideas that it takes too far?

### Readings
- [Introduction to Effective Altruism](https://www.effectivealtruism.org/articles/introduction-to-effective-altruism/)     - If you earn a typical income in the U.S. and donate 10% of your earnings each year to an effective charity, you can save dozens of lives over your lifetime. 
    - Some interventions are more cost-effective than others. These usually span several orders of magnitude. For HIV:

    - Criteria for important causes: 
        - Great in scale (affects many lives, by a great amount)
        - Highly neglected (few others are working on the problem)
        - Highly solvable (high marginal value of additional inputs)
    - Examples of very important causes: 
        - Extreme poverty 
        - Animal suffering
        - Existential risks
    - Options for helping: 
        - Earning to give
        - Working on problems directly

    - [Long-lasting insecticide-treated nets (LLIN)](https://www.givewell.org/international/technical/programs/insecticide-treated-nets#HowcosteffectiveisLLINdistribution) are one of the most cost-effective ways to save lives. On average, it costs around \$7,500 to save an under-5 life, or \$3,000 when adjusted for developmental disorders and disability. 
    - The average household (family of 4 earning \$60,000/year) is in the richest 6.4% of the world population, with an income 16-fold the global average (adjusted for PPP). 
    
### Takeaways
Effective altruism is built on a utilitarian ethic: if you want to maximize the good you contribute to the world, you should focus on 

### Questions
1. What is the value of future populations? How do they compare to current populations? I suspect that a decaying scale factor would capture our intuitions quite well. 
2. What is the value of giving now vs. later (in your will)? You would need to compare compounding benefits from chained effects (e.g., malaria prevention => improved health/education => lower fertility rate => ...) against the historic rise in the stock market (around 5% per year after inflation). 
3. How do you compare immediate benefits against
4. How do you address psychological factors? 
5. 

## 2. Which Social Interventions Work? (2/15/2018)

### Topic
> This week's speaker is Alexander Coppock, Assistant Professor of Political Science at Yale and resident fellow of the Institution for Social Policy Studies. He received his Ph.D. in political science from Columbia University (2016). His principal research interest lies in political persuasion and its implications for the malleability of public opinion in the context of elections. His interests extend beyond persuasion to the design and analysis of randomized experiments.
