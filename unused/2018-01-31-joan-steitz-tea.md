## tl;dr
Joan Steitz talks about gender diversity in research and her own scientific career. 

## On College Teas
College Teas (formerly Master's Teas) bring guest speakers to speak with students over tea and light snacks. Guests might be authors, actors, politicians, professors, or doing other interesting work. In my shortsightedness, I missed the opportunity to attend many of these awesome meetings, including with a former FBI director and a former President of Pakistan. But as a senior, I have found more time to attend and enjoy these kinds of functions.

## Introduction

According to the circulated [flyer](/PDF/joan-steitz-tea-ad.pdf) (paraphrased): 
> Joan Steitz is a Sterling Professor of Molecular Biophysics and Biochemistry (MB&B) at Yale, and an investigator of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute. Her work at Yale centers on RNA structure and function. In 1979, Steitz and her colleagues discovered cellular particles called small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs), a major breakthrough in the field of RNA splicing. Steitz is a member of the AAAS, APS, NAS, and IoM. 

According to her colleague, Dr. De La Cruz (Head of Branford College, Professor of MB&B)

> I really think Joan Steitz is Yale's most important scientist. This has nothing to do with the fact that she's a woman--that's just the cherry on top. Unlike many of Yale's powerful figures, she's also really nice!

I actually worked in Joan Steitz's lab during my sophomore year. I was interested in RNA biology at the time, and Yale had no end of accomplished scientists in this area. However, I recognized Prof. Steitz from the "featured scientists" section of my cherished copy of Campbell Biology, and I thought I'd talk with her first. For a little while, I worked with postdoc Paulina Pawlica on identifying TUTase enzymes involved in HSUR1-mediated degradation of RNA. I later left to invest more time in my computational interests, but working in the Steitz lab was definitely an interesting and foundational learning experience. 

## The Tea
The tea was setup with Prof. Steitz and a student moderator seated at the center, and everyone else gathered around. We talked for about an hour and then went to eat dinner in Branford dining hall. 

### Steitz's Background
We heard a lot about Professor Steitz's journey, much of which I had already known from her [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joan_A._Steitz). As a quick recap: Steitz was born in Minnesota and graduated with a chemistry degree from Antioch College, Ohio. She first became interested in molecular biology while working at the Alex Rich lab at MIT. Steitz was worried about her ability to succeed as a woman in science, but ultimately turned down medical school for graduate school at Harvard, where she worked with James Watson. She completed her postdoc at Cambridge before coming to Yale. 

### Mentorship
- Prof. De La Cruz talked about first interview experience--the importance of teaching and mentoring undergrads
- Core of contributions to science

### Gender Issues
- Implicit Bias and Stereotype Threat
- First choice advisor turned her down "you're just going to start a family and leave the lab."

### Questions
- Ethical issues
- Reproducibility
- Interesting seminars/advances outside her field
- Question about the President's anti-science perspective. 

## Branford Dinner
- Sat in the back room; mostly talked politics. 

## Concluding Thoughts
No mention of her husband woot. 

## Update
The Yale Daily News wrote [a piece](https://yaledailynews.com/blog/2018/02/01/steitz-reflects-women-in-science/) on this tea!
