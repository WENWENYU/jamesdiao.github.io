## tl;dr
Former Maryland Governer Martin O'Malley gave a great speech on American immigration policy. I learned a lot about the underlying political theory, as well as some common misconceptions and false equivalences.  

This was my second time attending a Yale Political Union (YPU) debate. For more background on the YPU and their debate events, check out my [last post](/archives/2018/09/05/ypu-bobby-jindal) on Bobby Jindal's talk. 

## Introduction

Over the past month, immigration has really taken the spotlight. In local news, a Yale student's father was [detained by ICE](https://yaledailynews.com/blog/2017/10/23/free-melecio-goes-national/), leading to a national campaign (#FreeMelecio) and his daughter's symbolic attendance at the State of the Union. Deportation orders forced two New Haven residents to [seek sanctuary](http://www.nhregister.com/news/article/Pinos-set-for-deportation-seeks-sanctuary-in-12394791.php) at a church right outside campus. In national news, the repeal of DACA shocked the country and triggered a government shutdown. And of course, Trump's proposed border wall is still the subject of heated debate. 

Immigration reform has always struck me as the kind of topic that is very easy to have opinions on without much background. Not wanting to be one of those people, I decided to read up a bit more on immigration policy and hear from someone who has played an active role in determining immigration policy for years.

As a governor and mayor, Martin O'Malley made several decisions influencing the status of undocumented immigrants in Baltimore and Maryland. Wikipedia provides a relevant and concise introduction of his background (edited and spliced for conciseness): 

> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; Martin O'Malley is an American politician and attorney who served as the 61st Governor of Maryland from 2007-2015. He previously served as the Mayor of Baltimore, on the Baltimore City Council, as chair of the Democratic Governors Association, and as a visiting professor at Johns Hopkins's Carey Business School. O'Malley ran for the 2016 presidential election, but suspended his campaign after finishing third in the Iowa caucuses.  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; As governor, O'Malley signed a law making the children of undocumented immigrants eligible for in-state college tuition; a majority (58%) of state voters passed the law. During the 2014 crisis involving undocumented immigrant children from Central America crossing the border, O'Malley faced White House criticism for refusing to open a facility to house them.  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; O'Malley endorses a path to citizenship, deferred action programs, limiting detentions, and stricter border enforcement. 

O'Malley's [presidential campaign website](https://martinomalley.com/policy/immigration/) provides a more detailed breakdown. 

## Overview

O'Malley was clearly a practiced orator. He only referenced his notes occasionally, and answered questions as smoothly as he delivered the speech itself. He cited evidence constantly and injected his speech with bits of flair. It's difficult to fact-check during a speech, of course, but the level of boo-hiss helped me gauge which claims I should look up later. 

### O'Malley's Argument

O'Malley started by quoting from "The New Colossus," a well-known sonnet by Emma Lazarus about the Statue of Liberty: 

> Not like the brazen giant of Greek fame,
With conquering limbs astride from land to land;
Here at our sea-washed, sunset gates shall stand
A mighty woman with a torch, whose flame
Is the imprisoned lightning, and her name
MOTHER OF EXILES. From her beacon-hand
Glows world-wide welcome; her mild eyes command
The air-bridged harbor that twin cities frame.  
"Keep, ancient lands, your storied pomp!" cries she
With silent lips. "Give me your tired, your poor,
Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free,
The wretched refuse of your teeming shore.
Send these, the homeless, tempest-tost to me,
I lift my lamp beside the golden door!"

He then threw out a short and unstructured litany of arguments about the spirit of American welcoming, the dignity of persons, the ethical wrong of creating stateless people, and the racism and fear that he believes to drive immigration hard-liners. 

### My Thoughts
I was surprised by how long O'Malley spent framing the resolution, "support sanctuary cities," within the broader context of immigration reform. The cynical side of me thinks that this is just so that he can lean on more practiced, off-topic arguments (it sounded a bit like a recycled campaign speech). Still, his approach did expand the breadth of topics I learned about.  

I was especially interested in the argument against creating "stateless people," and violating [Article 14 of the UN Declaration of Human Rights](http://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/), that "everyone has the right to a nationality." In high school debate, I had read a bit about Agamben's concept of *Homo Sacer*, and it helped me wrap the impact of deportation around some political theory.  

I was also interested in how he connected current immigration policy (including Trump's infamous comment about "shithole countries") to historic exclusionary anti-Irish and anti-Chinese legislation. It called attention to the history of immigration policy and its racial components. I only wished he spent a bit more time expanding on these parallels later in his speech. 

With these starting points, O'Malley made three key arguments, which he enumerated as "Facts": (1) healthy immigration levels are key to US economic prosperity, (2) new immigrants strengthen public safety, and (3) new immigrants reaffirm American values. I summarize each of them along with my own thoughts below. 

### 1. Economic Prosperity

#### O'Malley's Argument
Immigrants are more likely to start businesses. In fact, 1st and 2nd generation immigrants have founded [over 40% of the Fortune 500](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/the-avenue/2017/12/04/almost-half-of-fortune-500-companies-were-founded-by-american-immigrants-or-their-children/), contributing to the employment of over 12 million workers worldwide.

On the whole, higher immigrant diversity have also been shown to be related to higher productivity and wages. There is no evidence that immigrants steal jobs or force down wages. On the contrary: as diversity rose 1 standard deviation in the workplace, [wages rose 1.6%](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/more-immigration-means-higher-wages-for-all-workers_us_55a3c5c6e4b0b8145f7300cb); a similar rise in the city as a whole increased wages by by 5.8%. Even low-skill immigrants contribute to this increase.

All told, a health level of immigration is important for U.S. economic prosperity.

## Notes


Fact 2: strengthens public safety, esp if hope of obtainjng citizenship. Not pouring over the border. More Mex leaving than entering. Net migration is zero/neg in recent years. DACA less likely to be incarcerated (44%). 

Fact 3: reaffirm Am values. Racism underlies am values. Risked their lives to come here, willingness to work hard to give a better future. 62% ten yr or longer. 90% 5+. Part of usa. Not handouts, just a fair shot. 65,000 new imm in armed forces, 900 dreamers. He had attended their funerals, touched the casket, wept with parents. Mayor cannot turn in their own local law enforcement into fed tool. For-profit internment centers. Creating a whole class of stateless people. Statue of liberty not barbed wire. 

? What is a healthy level of immigrstion
Healthy level of immigration (1925 healthier) around 13%. 

? Zero tolerance policing and effects on protected communities. 
Public trust to sustain public safety gains. Reelected with 88% vote. High support. Stopping openair drug dealing. They saw the diff. 

? Nullify fed regulations in general? 
Gets to the heart of federalism. No, not just reject environmental laws. BUT, states and loca governments have jurisdiction over certain topics. Checking despotism; cannot create national police force for immigrant roundup. Abusive police powers. If they have warrants, bring them. They did not have them in our state. Cannot sweep up people for driving ticket or tailighr. 325k interned, waiting for months. For profit basis. Havent been that way since jap intern camps. Backbone to stand up.

? Heuristic for civil disobedience. 
Obedient to the constitution. 

? What is the Spirit of the law? Intent? Natural law? 


### Questions
Federalist Papers 76 (Alexander Hamilton; "there will come a day... resisting despot")


## Concluding Thoughts

O'Malley's arguments seemed reasonable and well-cited. However, his arguments and evidence tended to defend Dreamers and the benefits that immigrants bring. He spoke little on sanctuary cities, federalism, civil disobedience, and constitutional authority. His rhetoric doesn't perfectly match his record as governor (particularly on preventing deportations), but he seems genuinely committed to certain policy priorities, such as securing a path to citizenship. 

All in all, I'm convinced that immigration reform deserves all the attention that it's been getting. I have a better handle on how DACA, ICE enforcement, and deportation policies all fit together, and I'm interested in seeing how the public conversation continues to evolve around these issues. 

## Interesting moments
> Student 1: "O'Malley was lookin' pretty good. If he were younger, I'd shoot my shot."  
Student 2: "He's no Joe Biden, but definitely, I would too."
> Student (Tory Party): "This week, we will debate 'Arrange Your Child's Marriage.' at [X] location, [Y] time."  
O'Malley: *Rubs face*.
