In my junior year of college, I was really struggling with some major life decisions: whether I was ready to commit to research and academia, whether I was going to do an MD/PhD, how my career priorities matched my family priorities, etc. Hearing about other people and their paths worked wonders for clarifying my own goals and motivating me to pursue them. In no particular order, here are a few people whom I found particularly inspirational. 

1. Jay Bradner: people can do great things while doing the right thing
2. George Church: people can dream big
3. Anthony Philippakis: people can juggle tasks
4. Marvin Chun: the bamboo ceiling is coming apart
