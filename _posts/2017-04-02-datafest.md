Here's a summary from a [news release](http://newsletter.blogs.wesleyan.edu/2017/04/10/wesleyan-team-honored-for-best-innovation-at-2017-datafest/?gaclick=featured), with a few changes for brevity:

> The DataFest competition was held March 31 to April 2 at Exley Science Center. 75 students participated in the annual analysis competition, organized by the Quantitative Analysis Center (QAC) under the auspices of the American Statistical Association.

> During DataFest, students are presented with a large, complex data set and work over the weekend to explore, analyze and present their findings. Teams of 3-5 students work together and compete against other teams from Wesleyan, Connecticut College, Yale University, Lafayette College, University of Connecticut and Trinity College.

> At the end of DataFest, each team had 5 minutes to present their findings to the judges. The judging panel included data scientists, research analysts and a biostatistician from Boehringer-Ingelheim, CKM Advisors, The Brattle Group, Pfizer and TEK systems at Pratt and Whitney. DataFest winners were honored with a $50 cash prize, a medal, a certificate, and a year-long membership to the American Statistical Association.

> Anscombe's Quartet, a team from Yale, won Best-in-Show. Other honorable mentions include: Unsupervised Leopards (Lafayette and Wesleyan), for "Best Data Preparation," Coup D'ata (Trinity College), for Best Pattern Detection, and Data Baes (Wesleyan), for "Best Innovation."
