![DataFest 2017](http://datafest.blogs.wesleyan.edu/) was definitely an interesting experience.

Here's a summary from a ![news release:](http://newsletter.blogs.wesleyan.edu/2017/04/10/wesleyan-team-honored-for-best-innovation-at-2017-datafest/?gaclick=featured) 

The competition was held March 31 to April 2 at Exley Science Center. Seventy-five students from six institutions participated in the annual analysis competition.

During DataFest, students are presented with a large, complex data set and work over the weekend to explore, analyze and present their findings. Teams of three to five students work together and compete against other teams from Wesleyan, Connecticut College, Yale University, Lafayette College, University of Connecticut and Trinity College.

Under the auspices of the American Statistical Association, the event is organized by the Quantitative Analysis Center (QAC).

At the end of DataFest, each team had five minutes to present their findings to the judges. The judging panel included data scientists, research analysts and a biostatistician from Boehringer-Ingelheim, CKM Advisors, The Brattle Group, Pfizer and TEK systems at Pratt and Whitney. DataFest winners were honored with a $50 cash prize, a medal, a certificate, and a year-long membership to the American Statistical Association.

DataFest winners included Anscombe’s Quartet, a team from Yale, which won Best-in-Show; Unsupervised Leopards, a team from Lafayette and Wesleyan, received an award for "Best Data Preparation." Coup D’ata, a team from Trinity College, took honorable mention with “Best Pattern Detection.” Data Baes, a team from Wesleyan, was awarded "Best Innovation."
