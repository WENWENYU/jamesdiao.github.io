A few of my more memorable clinical experiences. Just blurbs for now- will hopefully expand on details/reflections soon. 

#### Pediatric Oncology, Texas Children's Hospital, Houston, TX
1. A few physicians have joint care over a patient. The newest scan shows tumor shrinkage, a promising sign for the updated treatment. The doctors argue over who gets to tell the patient.  
2. On a desk, I see a small shelf of cards from former patients. She tells me that this is her favorite part of the job: receiving life updates from former patients who are doing well at school, learning to drive, and going to college.  
3. One very young child has been living with cancer for a few years. Her physician tells me that he has started to understand just how sick he is. 


#### Ophthalmology, Yale-New Haven Hospital, New Haven, CT
1. A patient asks his/her physician (a black woman), if (s)he can be seen by different physician. She asks him/her why, and (s)he refuses to say. After some discussion (calm and not argumentative), she hands his/her care over to a colleague. 
2. One patient casually tells his/her physician about the different illegal drugs (s)he has used recently. 
3. The physician tells me I can go home a few hours early because she'll be writing notes the rest of the time, and there won't be anything interesting to see. 


#### Radiation Oncology, Smilow Cancer Center, New Haven, CT
1. A patient comes in for a yearly check-up. His/her physician greets him/her like an old friend, and makes sure that his patient has his personal contact information, "in case anything acts up."" The patient turns to me and says, "I just want you to know you're learning from the best. The very best."


#### Nutritional Counseling, HAVEN Free Clinic, Fair Haven, CT
1. A patient comes in to talk about smoking cessation. His/her uncle recently died of lung cancer, and (s)he is still unable to quit. 
2. A patient comes in to ask about how to reduce his/her weight. Listening to his/her day-to-day, I begin to understand the obstacles that make healthy choices incredibly difficult for low-income populations. 

#### Recreational Therapy, Children Psychiatric Inpatient Service, New Haven, CT
1. 

#### Staff Support, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX
1.
