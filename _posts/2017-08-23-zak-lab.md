## tl;dr

#### Non-technical
- I estimate the predictive value of genetic testing for certain heart conditions and how this can differ across ethnic groups. 
- I also build tools to help others make similar analyses. 

#### Technical
- Estimation of penetrance for secondary genetic findings across ancestral populations. 
- Developing clinvaR, an R package (code library) for gene-level analysis of variants. 


## Background 

#### Non-technical
A central goal of clinical genetics is to personalize medicine; that is, to look at differences in someone’s genome (i.e., genetic variants) and predict whether that person is more predisposed to certain diseases or more responsive to certain medications. While some genetic variants are very well understood (e.g., CAG repeats in Huntington’s disease), others remain highly inconclusive (e.g., certain point mutations in BRCA2). Because there is so much uncertainty, most genetic test reports do not contain risks scores (e.g., 95% chance of a later diagnosis). Instead, they typically report risk on a categorical scale--from benign (1) to pathogenic (5)--with questionable clinical utility. Right now, researchers are trying to aggregate these diverse claims into standard databases while culling out false claims. Among other goals, they are also working to develop standards for which studies to trust and which variants to report. 

#### Technical
Much of personalized medicine aims to connect genetic variants with disease states. However, there remains limited consensus on the clinical significance of secondary findings. Secondary findings are not related to any diagnostic indication (e.g. when screening healthy individuals/newborns) and are associated with an increased risk of false positives. To balance this risk, the American College on Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) recommends that sequencing laboratories report secondary findings in a minimum list of 59 genes (ACMG-59). Currently, no study has yet evaluated the clinical impact of applying these recently released guidelines to ethnically diverse populations.
