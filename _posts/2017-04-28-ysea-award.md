Today, I was surprised to receive an award from the Yale Science and Engineering Association. I unfortunately missed the awards dinner because of a friend's birthday party I had already committed to, but it was a nice honor nonetheless. I was not surprised by any of the other names on the list, but it was definitely a pleasant surprise to be named among them.
