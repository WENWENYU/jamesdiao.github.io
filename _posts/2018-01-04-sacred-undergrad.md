<b> Undergraduate Learning is Sacred </b>

My research mentor once told me that he considers undergrad to be a sacred time for learning. He was always super understanding when research work conflicted with exams, telling me to focus on school. At the time, I didn't quite understand what he meant by "sacred." How was undergrad learning so different from in high school or grad school, or even reading research papers? But now that I'm in my last semester of classes, I think I understand what he means. 

During undergrad, we have the protected time to learn broadly and deeply, far beyond what we'll ever need in our careers. At Yale, I must have picked up a thousand awesome ideas that have changed the way I think about the world, but which I have not a remote chance of ever using. 

<br/> 
<b> Specialization and Irreversibility </b>

The uniqueness of undergrad seems to come from a broader trend of specialization, which I believe is expressed quite well in Matt Might's famous illustration:

Imagine a circle containing all human knowledge, with each stage of learning adding additional knowledge (undergraduate => graduate => beyond). Learning begins broadly, but soon begins to focus. And one day, this learning might all culminate in a real contribution. 

In other words, undergrad is both the first instance of specialization and the last instance of building broad foundations. From here on out, everything I learn will probably be goal-oriented and "peaky." Pre-clinical courses to prepare for clinical clerkships, or maybe some CS courses geared towards a technique I need in lab. Don't get me wrong--I'm really excited to learn about all these things and put them to good use. But it feels strange to think that, without an undergraduate class to push me, I might never learn what a Langrangian is, or understand the theory behind martingales. There's an opportunity cost to go back to fundamentals and theory, and it'll only get higher as I progress in my career. 

<br/> 
<b> My Own Path </b>

To be fair, it sounds almost silly to speak of specialization as irreversible. I'm twenty-two, for heaven's sake. People change their interests all the time, and I'm always free to read, to dabble, and to learn in my free time. I guess my worry isn't some hard barrier, but rather the somewhat obvious fact that the world is big, that trade-offs exist, and that I can't possibly fill out the entire circle. I'll just have to learn to live with that. 


At the same time, my own coursework isn't quite the liberal arts ideal--between my two majors, premed coursework, and Yale's distribution requirements, there have been quite a few constraints on my choice of classes. And the few choices I had were generally "inside the box." Part of this is because I love these certain "subcircles," and I cared more about filling those out than expanding to new circles. The other part was because I was good at them, and I like doing well (or on the flip side, I didn't have the guts to risk doing poorly). Either way, I probably could have taken better advantage of my time at Yale. 


As for the next part of my education? Luckily, my chosen path gives me plenty of time to wring my hands and figure it out. I may be running out of sacred undergraduate years, but there will always be opportunities for undirected learning. I hope to take them as they come.
