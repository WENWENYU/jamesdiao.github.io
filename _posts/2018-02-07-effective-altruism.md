This Spring, I applied to and joined the Yale Effective Altriusm Fellowship. I'll give more details later, but I just want to use this post to keep track of what I learn throughout.

## 1. Introduction to Effective Altriusm (2/7/2018) <a name="intro"></a>

### Topic
> Effective altruism is premised on the idea of 'doing good better', but why does this matter, and how far can this be taken? For the very first dinner, we will focus on the fundamentals: Why is the EA movement appealing and are there some ideas that it takes too far?

### Readings
1. [Introduction to Effective Altruism](https://www.effectivealtruism.org/articles/introduction-to-effective-altruism/)
2. [How Rich Am I?](https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/get-involved/how-rich-am-i/)
    
### Reading Summary
- If you earn a typical income in the U.S. and donate 10% of your annual earnings, you could save dozens of lives over your lifetime. 
- The average U.S. household (family of 4 earning \$60,000/year) is in the richest 6.4% of the world population, with an income 16 times the global average (adjusted for PPP). 
- Some interventions are more cost-effective than others. 
    - These usually span several orders of magnitude. For HIV: <img src="/img/yea-hiv-costs.png" alt="Cost-Effectiveness of HIV Interventions" style="width: 630px; "/>
    - [Long-lasting insecticide-treated nets (LLIN)](https://www.givewell.org/international/technical/programs/insecticide-treated-nets#HowcosteffectiveisLLINdistribution) top the hierarchy. On average, \$7,500 will save an under-5 life (or \$3,000 when adjusted for health and disability). 
- Criteria for important causes: 
    - Great in scale (affects many lives, by a great amount)
    - Highly neglected (few others are working on the problem)
    - Highly solvable (high marginal value of additional inputs)

### Discussion Summary 
1. Why the focus on donations and stepwise progress? What about root causes, side effects, and downstream effects?
> Donations to effective charities are a quick win, while root causes are high-impact but high-uncertainty. Groups like GiveWell provide recommendations that take efficacy studies and side effects into account. For the general public, focusing on donations to recommended charities is likely the right strategy. 
2. How do you address psychological factors, such as a preference for family, a love of barbeque, or a simple unwillingness to give? Can we tolerate moderate approaches when radicalism is justified? 
> I see psychological factors as soft or hard constraints, depending on how strong the preference is. EA can encourage moderate approaches (e.g., small donations, less meat) when other options are not doable, especially if there are plans to scale up. 
3. How do we evaluate suboptimal causes and interventions? 
> Acknowledge that the right thing to do is to ignore them, but treat a preference for working on them as a psychological factor (i.e., better than nothing). Still, effectiveness scales with interest, and sometimes even less important causes can be optimal. 
4. What is the value of future populations? How do they compare to current populations? 
> Likely a factor between 0 and 1. A decaying scale factor is consistent with decision theory and could explain our intuitions. 
5. What is the value of giving now vs. later (in your will)? 
> You would need to compare the compounding benefits from chained effects  
(e.g., malaria prevention => improved health/education => lower fertility rate => ...) against the historic rise in the stock market (around 5% per year after inflation). There are many factors at play and it's really hard to say which is better. 


## 2. Which Social Interventions Work? (2/15/2018) <a name="uct"></a>

### Topic
> This week's speaker is Alexander Coppock, Assistant Professor of Political Science at Yale and resident fellow of the Institution for Social Policy Studies. He received his Ph.D. in political science from Columbia University (2016). His principal research interest lies in political persuasion and its implications for the malleability of public opinion in the context of elections. His interests extend beyond persuasion to the design and analysis of randomized experiments.

### Readings

- [Is it Fair to Say that Most Social Programs Don't Work?](https://80000hours.org/articles/effective-social-program/)

### Reading Summary
- To recommend top charities, GiveWell uses: efficacy evidence, cost-per-life-saved, cost-per-economic-benefit, room for more funding, and transparency. 
    - Overhead costs are not the be-all-end-all, and might be necessary for some causes. Donating to a high-overhead charity can actually be better, depending on its cause. 
    - Earning to give is less psychologically rewarding, but much more effective. 
- There are thousands of social interventions in the U.S., but only a small fraction are ever rigorously evaluated (1-2%). [Survey of social programs by RCTs](https://web.archive.org/web/20170428214714/http://www.arnoldfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/Request-for-Proposals-Low-Cost-RCT-FINAL.pdf)
    - Of individual projects, only 20% have a significant positive effect size relative to cost. 
    - In whole "areas" (e.g., education), the average effect size is likely positive, driven by a few very successful projects. 
    
### Discussion Summary
- Dr. Coppock argued that [unconditional cash transfers (UCTs)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconditional_cash_transfer) are [generally reliable and effective interventions](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29139110). 
    - *Benefits*: low overhead (piggybacks off other groups), individuals spend on what matters most to them, increases female empowerment when given to mothers, dramatic increase in measures of subjective well-being, improves health (although not use of health services) and school attendance. 
    - *Disadvantages*: constrained by what they can buy, some loss to "unnecessary" purchases. 
- GiveDirectly is the largest organization devoted to cash transfers. It was given top charity status by GiveWell in 2012, and has remained on the list since. 
- [Impact evaluation of GiveDirectly](https://www.poverty-action.org/study/impact-unconditional-cash-transfers-kenya): 
    - *Sample Size*: 503 poor households among 63 villages. 
    - *Experimental groups*: male or female head-of-household, lump-sum or monthly installments, and large or small transfers. 
    - *Positives*: (1) increased investments in livestock, furniture, and metal roofs.  
    (2) increased subjective well-being and female empowerment measures. 
    - *Concerns*: (1) self-reporting on purchases are unreliable, (2) observer-expectant effect, (3) lack of increased spending on health and education. 
- UCTs are not always optimal, but they are uniquely simple and scalable. This makes them the ideal benchmark against which new interventions should be evaluated. 

## 3. Effective Altruism and Systemic Change <a name="systemic"></a>

### Topic
> Discussions about Effective Altruism often turn into discussions about systemic change. Are the two in tension? Or are they in fact mutually supportive? This week we'll take on this topic, discussing views on long term changes to society.

## 4. The Economics of Global Poverty <a name="poverty"></a>

### Topic
> While donating to charity, we often consider not only where our donations are going, but also the impact our donations are making. But how do we know that our donations are having their intended effect? This week we'll examine development economics and the current evidence in poverty alleviation.  
This week's speaker is renowned development economist, Mark Rosenzweig, Frank Altschul Professor of International Economics and Director of the Economic Growth Center. His research has covered a wide range of topics, including marital and fertility decisions, risk coping mechanisms, labor markets, human capital decisions,  adoption of technologies, and  provision of local public goods. Rosenzweig received his B.A., M.A., and Ph.D. from Columbia University in 1969, 1971, and 1973, respectively.
