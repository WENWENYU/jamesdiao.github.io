### tl;dr

"I Side With" is a pretty neat website that, based on your answers to a hundred-or-so questions, compares your political beliefs with those of major candidates. Here are the main takeaways from [my answers](https://secure.isidewith.com/elections/2016-presidential/3369102431):

1. I'm more liberal than I thought, but probably still centrist relative to Yale standards. 
2. I'm most certain of my beliefs on social and electoral issues.  I'm least certain of my beliefs on foreign policy and immigration. 
3. My key disagreements with the liberal platform include support for GMOs, nuclear power, and work/skill-based immigration.

To be honest, I was kind of surprised--I thought my views were a bit closer to Clinton's.  
I suspect that my support for a single-payer healthcare system and electoral reform contributed the most to this difference.

Honestly, this is just a map of the country's liberal-conservative distribution.  
Not very interesting.  

### Figure 3: Breakdown by Issue

All pretty straightforward up until now. But here's the kicker:

Wow. I would not have guessed this result in a million years.  
Let's take a look at the exact questions I answered.  

<img src="/img/ISideWith/ISW_science.png" alt="Science" style="width: 550px;"/>

It looks like 3 for 4 agreement with both Trump and Clinton. Trump won out because the issues were weighted by assigned importance. Now for a point-by-point: 

#### Space Exploration 
> Not worth discussing--everyone agrees on this one. 

#### Mandatory Vaccinations (agree with Clinton, Stein, disagree with Trump)
> I regret putting "somewhat important." I waffled here because I wasn't quite sure what was meant by "required." I agree with any requirement that involves soft enforcement (e.g., fines, removal from public school systems, etc.), but I am very wary of a requirement that involves jail time. In general, I am worried about government use of force to back mandatory use of any health intervention. I don't have any particular doomsday scenario in mind, but abuses have happened before (e.g., compulsory sterilization), and seem to be worth hedging against. 

#### GMO Labels (agree with Trump, disagree with Clinton, Stein)
> GMO foods have enormous potential for reducing pesticide use, improving crop yields, and otherwise delivering value to consumers. I think that GMO-free labels are a huge marketing scam, and they unfairly stigmatize a very legitimate process. I put "most important" because I was quite sure about my answer, but it honestly should've been labeled "more" or "somewhat important."  

#### Nuclear Energy (agree with Trump, Clinton, disagree with Stein)
> Nuclear power is by far the best alternative to fossil fuels. It's clean, efficient, and most importantly, can actually generate power at scale. Solar, wind, and hydro power will never come close. It's not perfect--we can make improvements to waste storage and disposal, etc. But if we're serious about phasing out oil & gas, nuclear is pretty much the only way to go. 

So that's that! Four questions is quite few to be assigning to the science category, and I'm quite sure that a larger sample size would bring this outlier in line.
