Psychologist Arthur Aron performed a study ([The Experimental Generation of Interpersonal Closeness](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0146167297234003)) which introduces an interesting procedure for fostering closeness through vulnerability. To quote the study’s authors, "One key pattern associated with the development of a close relationship among peers is sustained, escalating, reciprocal, personal self-disclosure." This exercise was later popularized in the New York Times Article: [The 36 Questions That Lead to Love](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/11/fashion/no-37-big-wedding-or-small.html). 

Now, I'm not looking for love, but I am interested in the idea of self-knowledge, and I thought it would be a useful exercise to answer these questions myself, in just 3-4 sentences each. 

**1. Given the choice of anyone in the world, whom would you want as a dinner guest?**  
> Peter Singer, the philosophy professor at Princeton. He has written with incredibly clarity on all sorts of fascinating ethical edge cases and indictments of my way of life. I would love to pick his brains on the details, especially his views on (1) overcoming self-interest, (2) the repugnant conclusion, (3) personhood during sleep and unconsciousness, and (4) the (non-)existence of free will. 

**2. Would you like to be famous? In what way?**  
> Yes, I would. I don't want to be famous in the way Kanye West or Bill Gates are famous: the way that invades your private life and reduces you to caricature. But I do want fame in the sense of permanence and recognition of good work. This might be from patients, fellow academics, or even just friends and family. Either way, I have to admit that it's a significant drive behind my aspirations. 

**3. Before making a telephone call, do you ever rehearse what you are going to say? Why?**  
> Rarely. If I'm in an argument, I think carefully about how I'm going to present my side, and maybe what responses I should expect. This might be a habit from speech and debate. But I can't remember the last time I've done this. 

**4. What would constitute a "perfect" day for you?**  
> If a perfect day means maximizing some measure of happiness or contentedness, I can come up with plenty of wildly implausible scenarios that would fit the bill. One of my happiest moments this past year was crossing the Charles River on an inflatable raft to watch the fireworks on July 4th. My perfect day is just a string of impromptu excitements like this one, with a healthy dash of friends to back up my stories. 

**5. When did you last sing to yourself? To someone else?**  
> I sing to myself in the shower all the time, mostly the Hamilton soundtrack. I also sang for my mother's birthday about an hour ago, and rocked out with my awesome summer intern group on a Northeastern penthouse a few weeks ago. 

**6. If you were able to live to the age of 90 and retain either the mind or body of a 30-year-old for the last 60 years of your life, which would you want?**  
> Mind of a 30-year-old. I would experience some heeavy cognitive dissonance from seeing my friends and significant other age without me. Moreover, it's probably a lot easier to take care of one's body and preserve it well, than to do the same for one's mind. 

**7. Do you have a secret hunch about how you will die?**  
> Cancer. Part of this might just be the availability heuristic: I know many people who have been diagnosed with cancer, and some who have died from it. I know far fewer people who have died of other common causes of death, like heart disease or car accidents. It also seems like a suitably ironic way for a physician working in cancer biology (my tentative specialty) to go. 

**8. Name three things you and your partner appear to have in common.**  
> Since I'm trying to do this for a general reader, I'm just going to go for three fun facts. (1) I once danced as a follower in Silver Latin, (2) I once (humanely!) caught a mouse using just a water bottle, and (3) my girlfriend and I are the top-ranked team in the online game generals.io. 

**9. For what in your life do you feel most grateful?**  
> Winning the lottery of birth. 

**10. If you could change anything about the way you were raised, what would it be?**  
> More time getting to know parents. 

**11. Take four minutes and tell your partner your life story in as much detail as possible.**  
> Saved for later

**12. If you could wake up tomorrow having gained any one quality or ability, what would it be?**  
> Ability to control time

**13. If a crystal ball could tell you the truth about yourself, your life, the future or anything else, what would you want to know?**  
> Saved for later

**14. Is there something that you’ve dreamed of doing for a long time? Why haven't you done it?**  
> Hardcore ballroom training; competing pressures. 

**15. What is the greatest accomplishment of your life?**  
> Saved for later

**16. What do you value most in a friendship?**  
> Saved for later

**17. What is your most treasured memory?**  
> Saved for later

**18. What is your most terrible memory?**  
> Saved for later

**19. If you knew that in one year you would die suddenly, would you change anything about the way you are now living? Why?**  
> Saved for later

**20. What does friendship mean to you?**  
> Saved for later

**21. What roles do love and affection play in your life?**  
> Saved for later

**22. Alternate sharing something you consider a positive characteristic of your partner. Share a total of five items.**  
> Saved for later

**23. How close and warm is your family? Do you feel your childhood was happier than most other people's?**  
> Saved for later

**24. How do you feel about your relationship with your mother?**  
> Saved for later

**25. Make three true “we” statements each. For instance, “We are both in this room feeling ..."**
> Saved for later

**26. Complete this sentence: "I wish I had someone with whom I could share ..."**  
> Saved for later

**27. If you were going to become a close friend with your partner, please share what would be important for him or her to know.**  
> Saved for later

**28. Tell your partner what you like about them; be very honest this time, saying things that you might not say to someone you’ve just met.**  
> Saved for later

**29. Share with your partner an embarrassing moment in your life.**  
> Saved for later

**30. When did you last cry in front of another person? By yourself?**  
> Saved for later

**31. Tell your partner something that you like about them already.**  
> Saved for later

**32. What, if anything, is too serious to be joked about?**  
> Saved for later

**33. If you were to die this evening with no opportunity to communicate with anyone, what would you most regret not having told someone? Why haven’t you told them yet?**  
> Saved for later

**34. Your house, containing everything you own, catches fire. After saving your loved ones and pets, you have time to safely make a final dash to save any one item. What would it be? Why?**  
> Saved for later

**35. Of all the people in your family, whose death would you find most disturbing? Why?**  
> Saved for later

**36. Share a personal problem and ask your partner’s advice on how he or she might handle it. Also, ask your partner to reflect back to you how you seem to be feeling about the problem you have chosen.**  
> Saved for later
