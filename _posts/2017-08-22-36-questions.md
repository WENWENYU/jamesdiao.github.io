\[POST IN PROGRESS\]

Psychologist Arthur Aron performed a study ([The Experimental Generation of Interpersonal Closeness](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0146167297234003)) which introduces an interesting procedure for fostering closeness through vulnerability. To quote the study'Äôs authors, "One key pattern associated with the development of a close relationship among peers is sustained, escalating, reciprocal, personal self-disclosure." This exercise was later popularized in the New York Times Article: [The 36 Questions That Lead to Love](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/11/fashion/no-37-big-wedding-or-small.html). 

Now, I'm not looking for love, but I am interested in the idea of self-knowledge, and I thought it would be a useful exercise to answer these questions myself, in just 3-4 sentences each. 

**1. Given the choice of anyone in the world, whom would you want as a dinner guest\?**  
> Peter Singer, the philosophy professor at Princeton. He has written with incredibly clarity on all sorts of fascinating ethical edge cases and indictments of my way of life. I would love to pick his brains on the details, especially his views on (1) overcoming self-interest, (2) the repugnant conclusion, (3) personhood during sleep and unconsciousness, and (4) the (non-)existence of free will. 

**2. Would you like to be famous\? In what way\?**  
> Yes, I would. I don't want to be famous in the way Kanye West or Bill Gates are famous: the way that invades your private life and reduces you to caricature. But I do want fame in the sense of permanence and recognition of good work. This might be from patients, fellow academics, or even just friends and family. Either way, I have to admit that it's a significant drive behind my aspirations. 

**3. Before making a telephone call, do you ever rehearse what you are going to say\? Why\?**  
> Rarely. If I'm in an argument, I think carefully about how I'm going to present my side, and maybe what responses I should expect. This might be a habit from speech and debate. But I can't remember the last time I've done this. 

**4. What would constitute a "perfect" day for you\?**  
> If a perfect day means maximizing some measure of happiness or contentedness, I can come up with plenty of wildly implausible scenarios that would fit the bill. One of my happiest moments this past year was crossing the Charles River on an inflatable raft to watch the fireworks on July 4th. My perfect day is just a string of impromptu excitements like this one, with a healthy dash of friends to back up my stories. 

**5. When did you last sing to yourself\? To someone else\?**  
> I sing to myself in the shower all the time, mostly the Hamilton soundtrack. I also sang for my mother's birthday about an hour ago, and rocked out with my awesome summer intern group on a Northeastern penthouse a few weeks ago. 

**6. If you were able to live to the age of 90 and retain either the mind or body of a 30-year-old for the last 60 years of your life, which would you want\\?**  
> Mind of a 30-year-old. I would experience some heavy cognitive dissonance from seeing my friends and significant other age without me. Moreover, it's probably a lot easier to take care of one's body and preserve it well, than to do the same for one's mind. 

**7. Do you have a secret hunch about how you will die\?**  
> Cancer. Part of this might just be the availability heuristic: I know many people who have been diagnosed with cancer, and some who have died from it. I know far fewer people who have died of other common causes of death, like heart disease or car accidents. It also seems like a suitably ironic way for a physician working in cancer biology (my tentative specialty) to go. 

**8. Name three things you and your partner appear to have in common.**  
> Since I'm trying to do this for a general reader, I'm just going to go for three fun facts. (1) I once danced as a follower in Silver Latin, (2) I once (humanely\!) caught a mouse using just a water bottle, and (3) my girlfriend and I are the top-ranked team in the online game generals.io. 

**9. For what in your life do you feel most grateful\?**  
> Winning the lottery of birth. My father grew up in rural China as the son of a subsistence farmer. I have visited before, and I know just how easily my family could be there now. I'm grateful to have every privilege of an upper-middle class American. 

**10. If you could change anything about the way you were raised, what would it be\?**  
> More time getting to know parents. My parents are both working professionals, and they were quite busy when I was growing up. This may have also been a cultural thing, but I feel that I'm not as close with my family as other people my age, and we don't do that many things together. I hope that my kids will have a different experience. 

**11. Take four minutes and tell your partner your life story in as much detail as possible.**  
> Ah, I'm too lazy to do this one. Check my ![about](/about) page for a quick overview\!

**12. If you could wake up tomorrow having gained any one quality or ability, what would it be\?**  
> Ability to control time. It's basically super-speed, teleportation, and pseudo-immortality all wrapped up in one. 

**13. If a crystal ball could tell you the truth about yourself, your life, the future or anything else, what would you want to know\?**  
> I actually have no idea. I'd be really interested in how my priorities will change over time (as they do for most people), so that I don't spend my life chasing things that I won't value down the road. That being said, I'd also be interested in meeting the real historical Jesus Christ.

**14. Is there something that you've dreamed of doing for a long time\? Why haven't you done it\?**  
> Hardcore ballroom training. Every time I see one of our fabulous dance shows or watch the really good people at competitions, I have this powerful inspiration to be like them. Then I get home and realize that I've committed my time ten million ways already. 

**15. What is the greatest accomplishment of your life\?**  
> This actually isn't at all important now, but when I was in high school, I was one of two sophomores who competed at the speech and debate state competition. I worked so darn hard for that event (I was such a tryhard back then), and actually made it to the quarterfinal round. It felt so good, I can't really understand why.

**16. What do you value most in a friendship\?**  
> Thinking about my current friends, the most important thing is knowing that they care about me and will be there when I need them. On a more day-to-day level, the right balance of extraversion and introversion is really important to me. Some people dominate conversations and others don't contribute anything, and I have a hard time staying friends with such people, no matter how nice or fun they are.  

**17. What is your most treasured memory\?**  
> One great recent memory was crossing the Charles River on an inflatable boat to watch the fireworks on the night of July 4th. It was a boat meant for 4 people, but we squeezed in 8 of my favorite people. We crossed the river twice by the MIT bridge (around 0.5 mile), where they were launching the fireworks. It was fabulous. We were close enough to smell the smoke and feel the shudder. My favorite quote from that night:  
Q: "Shouldn't we do something American or patriotic today\?"  
A: "I can't think of anything more American than crossing a river at midnight."  
I only regret that we didn't bring any tea to recreate the Boston Tea Party. 

**18. What is your most terrible memory\?**  
> A bit personal- going to skip this one\!


**19. If you knew that in one year you would die suddenly, would you change anything about the way you are now living\? Why\?**  
> Saved for later.

**20. What does friendship mean to you\?**  
> I'm fairly liberal with the title friend. Anyone whom I would normally ask to schedule a meal with. Everyone else is an acquaintance, but I might call them friend anyway. 


I won't answer the last 16, which are all pretty personal (or require two people), but they were certainly some of the most interesting to read and think about.  

**21. What roles do love and affection play in your life\?**  

**22. Alternate sharing something you consider a positive characteristic of your partner. Share a total of five items.**  

**23. How close and warm is your family\? Do you feel your childhood was happier than most other people's\?**  

**24. How do you feel about your relationship with your mother\?**  

**25. Make three true "we"Äù statements each. For instance, "ÄúWe are both in this room feeling ..."**  

**26. Complete this sentence: "I wish I had someone with whom I could share ..."**  

**27. If you were going to become a close friend with your partner, please share what would be important for him or her to know.**  

**28. Tell your partner what you like about them; be very honest this time, saying things that you might not say to someone you'Äôve just met.**  

**29. Share with your partner an embarrassing moment in your life.**  

**30. When did you last cry in front of another person\? By yourself\?**  

**31. Tell your partner something that you like about them already.**  

**32. What, if anything, is too serious to be joked about\?**  

**33. If you were to die this evening with no opportunity to communicate with anyone, what would you most regret not having told someone\? Why haven'Äôt you told them yet\?**  

**34. Your house, containing everything you own, catches fire. After saving your loved ones and pets, you have time to safely make a final dash to save any one item. What would it be\? Why\?**  

**35. Of all the people in your family, whose death would you find most disturbing\? Why\?**  

**36. Share a personal problem and ask your partner'Äôs advice on how he or she might handle it. Also, ask your partner to reflect back to you how you seem to be feeling about the problem you have chosen.**
