I love these things called situation puzzles. In these games, an unknown situation is presented to a group of players, who must then try to figure out the details of the story by asking further questions. There is generally one question that the players aim to answer, or one "epiphany" that must be discovered. The person who initially presented the situation can only answer "yes" or "no" to questions (or occasionally "irrelevant").

I'll put together a list soon, but for now, there's a great list online here: [Jed's List of Situation Puzzles](http://www.kith.org/logos/things/sitpuz/situations.html).
