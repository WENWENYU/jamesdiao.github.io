### Easy

1. [Amoeba Jar](/html/amoeba-solution.html)<a name="AmoebaJar"></a>  
> You've successfully engineered a new species of amoeba with a very impressive doubling time of 3 minutes (i.e., every 3 minutes, each amoeba will split into 2 new amoeba). You put a single amoeba in a jar, and it takes exactly one hour to fill the jar. You put two amoeba in a second jar. How long does it take to fill the second jar?  
*Note: I actually heard this problem from my interviewer at Harvard Med; it's been super interesting to see how people approach it. So far, only 36% (9/25) of my friends (mostly STEM majors) have answered this correctly.*

2. [Cake Cutting](https://mathematicslounge.wordpress.com/2014/09/06/splitting-a-cake-with-a-missing-piece/)<a name="CakeCutting"></a>  
> Jeremy and Jane would like to split a cake, but their friend Bob has already cut out a piece for himself. Bob’s slice is a rectangle of arbitrary size and rotation. How can Jeremy and Jane divide the remaining cake into two equal portions using a single cut from their knife?

3. [Predicting Coin Flips](https://www.futilitycloset.com/2015/10/01/cruel-and-unusual-3/)<a name="PredictingCoinFlips"></a>  
> Two mathematicians have been arrested and will soon both be imprisoned in separate towers. Each morning, a guard at each tower will flip a coin and show the result to his prisoner. Each prisoner must then guess the result of the coin flip at the other tower. If at least one guess is correct, both prisoners are spared. But if both guesses are incorrect, both prisoners will be executed. The mathematicians are allowed to briefly confer before being locked up. What strategy can spare them indefinitely?

4. [St. Petersburg Lottery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Petersburg_paradox)<a name="StPetersburgLottery"></a>  
> This casino game involves flips of a fair coin. The pot starts with 2 cents. The player will continue flipping the coin until it lands tails. Every time the coin lands heads, the pot doubles; otherwise, the player keeps the money in the pot and the game ends. Altogether, the player wins 2k dollars, where k is the number of tosses. What's a fair price for entering the game? (needs math) 

5. [Coupon Collector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coupon_collector%27s_problem)<a name="CouponCollector"></a>  
> Given n coupons, how many coupons do you expect to draw with replacement before having drawn each coupon at least once? (needs math)  

6. [Two Envelopes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two_envelopes_problem)<a name="TwoEnvelopes"></a>  
> You are given two envelopes with money; one contains twice as much as the other. You may pick one envelope and keep the money it contains. Having chosen an envelope, you are given the chance to switch. Your friend argues that it is always beneficial to switch: "the other envelope contains 2A with probability 1/2 and A/2 with probability 1/2, so the expected value of the other envelope is: (1/2)(2A) + (1/2)(A/2) = (5/4)A." What is wrong with this argument?

### Medium

1. [King and Poison](https://medium.com/i-math/a-king-1000-bottles-of-wine-10-prisoners-and-a-drop-of-poison-2dd1959a8dd2)<a name="KingAndPoison"></a>  
> The King invites 1000 senators to his party, and each senator brings a bottle of wine. Soon after, the King discovers that one was poisoned. However, the King has 10 prisoners whom he decides can help him determine which bottle contains the poison. The poison has no effect on the prisoner until exactly 24 hours later, when the infected prisoner suddenly dies. The King needs to determine which bottle of wine is poisoned by tomorrow, and hence only has time for one round of testing. How can the King administer the wine to the prisoners to ensure that 24 hours from now, he is guaranteed to have found the poisoned wine bottle?

2. [100 Airplane Seats](https://medium.com/i-math/solving-an-advanced-probability-problem-with-virtually-no-math-5750707885f1)<a name="100AirplaneSeats"></a>  
> 100 passengers board an airplane with exactly 100 seats. Everyone has a ticket with an assigned seat number. However, the first passenger has lost their ticket and takes a random seat. Every subsequent passenger attempts to choose their own seat, but takes a random seat if their’s is taken. Suppose you are the very last passenger to board the plane. What is the probability that you will get your assigned seat?

3. [Prisoners and Lightbulb](https://sites.math.washington.edu/~morrow/336_11/papers/yisong.pdf)<a name="PrisonersAndLightbulb"></a>
> Starting tomorrow, 100 prisoners will be isolated and unable to communicate. Each day, the warden will choose one of the prisoners uniformly at random and place him in a room with a lightbulb and switch. The prisoner can observe the current state of the bulb (on or off) and chooses whether to toggle the lightbulb. The prisoner may also choose to announce whether (s)he believes all prisoners have visited the room at least once. If this announcement is true, all prisoners are set free; if not, all prisoners are executed. The prisoners are allowed to count how many days have elapsed. The prisoners may discuss with each other before the game begins the next day. What is the prisoners' best strategy to guarantee success and minimize their expected time of release?  
*Hard Addendum: how about if the prisoners cannot count the elapsed days?*  
*How about if every single prisoner needs to declare and be certain?*

4. [Amoebas Revisited](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/4768/amoeba-interview-question)<a name="AmoebasRevisited"></a>
> You place a single amoeba into a jar with infinite space and nutrients. After 3 minutes, that amoeba will divide into 1, 2, 3, or 0 (it dies before dividing) offspring with equal probability. What is the probability that the entire population eventually dies out? (needs math)

### Hard

1. [100 Pirates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pirate_game)<a name="100Pirates"></a>   
> 100 pirates discover a chest containing 100 gold coins, and need to divvy it up. The pirates are ranked based on seniority (Pirate 1 to Pirate n, where Pirate n is the most senior). The most senior pirate gets to propose a plan and then all the pirates vote on it. If at least half agree on the plan, the proposal passes. Otherwise, he is thrown off the ship and the next most senior pirate makes a proposal. The first priority of the pirates is to stay alive and the second is to maximize their take. The pirates are all rational, greedy, and perfect logicians. What plan can pirate n devise to win maximize his gold while winning enough votes? 

2. [201 Islanders](https://xkcd.com/solution.html)<a name="201Islanders"></a>
> There are 201 people on an island. 100 of them have blue eyes, 100 have brown eyes, and 1 has green eyes (the Guru). No one knows the color of their own eyes. Every night, a ferry stops at the island. Any islanders who have figured out the color of their own eyes will leave the island, and the rest stay. Everyone can see everyone else at all times and keeps a count of the number of people they see with each eye color (excluding themselves), but they cannot otherwise communicate. Once per day, the Guru tells them whether she sees at least one person with blue eyes. All islanders are perfect logicians. Everyone on the island knows all the rules in this paragraph. Who leaves the island, and on what night?

### Super Hard

1. [100 Prisoners](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_prisoners_problem)<a name="100Prisoners"></a>
> The prison warden offers 100 death row prisoners, who are numbered from 1 to 100, a last chance. A room contains a cupboard with 100 drawers. The warden randomly puts one prisoner's number in each closed drawer. The prisoners enter the room, one after another. Each prisoner may open and look into 50/100 drawers, in any order. The drawers are closed again afterwards. If, during this search, every prisoner finds his number, all prisoners are pardoned. Otherwise, all prisoners die. The prisoners may discuss strategy before the game begins. What is the prisoners' best strategy?

2. [Coins on a Chessboard](http://datagenetics.com/blog/december12014/index.html)<a name="CoinsAndChessboard"></a>
> The jailer will take you into a private cell. In the cell will be a chessboard. The jailer will take 64 coins and place them, one-by-one, on each square on the board. He will place the coins on the board in any way he wants (in a pattern, at random, etc.). Once all the coins have been placed, the jailer will point to one of the squares on the board and say: "This square is the magic square." You must then choose exactly one coin to turn over--heads to tails, or tails to heads. You cannot opt out of this choice. You will then be led out of the room, and your friend will be led in. Your friend will look at the board of coins and guess the magic square. If he guesses correctly, you are both pardoned. If he guesses incorrectly, you are both executed. The jailer explains these rules to you and your friend and then gives you time to confer. What is the strategy that maximizes your chance of escape?

3. [Partial Credit](https://terrytao.wordpress.com/2016/06/01/how-to-assign-partial-credit-on-an-exam-of-true-false-questions/)<a name="PartialCredit"></a>
> On a true-false test with n questions, every question must be answered with a subjective probability that it is correct. What reward functions f(p) can incentivize students to always report their true beliefs? Normalize f(p) such that f(1) = 1 and f(0.5) = 0.
