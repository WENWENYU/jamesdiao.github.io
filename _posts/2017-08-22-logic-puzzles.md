I really enjoy logic puzzles, and I thought I'd compile most of my favorites before I forgot them all! Some of these require math, but most do not. 


#### Easy
1. [St. Petersburg Lottery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Petersburg_paradox)  
> This casino game involves flips of a fair coin. The initial stake starts at 2 cents. If the coin lands heads, the pot doubles; otherwise, the game ends. Altogether, the player wins 2k dollars, where k equals number of tosses. What would be a fair price for entering the game?  

2. [Coupon Collector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coupon_collector%27s_problem) 
> Yale has a challenge to hook up with a student in all 14 residential colleges. Suppose you bring someone home every Wednesday evening. How many weeks do you expect to do this before completing the challenge?  
Alternatively: Given n coupons, how many coupons do you expect to draw with replacement before having drawn each coupon at least once?  

3. [Two Envelopes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two_envelopes_problem)
> You are given two envelopes with money; one contains twice as much as the other. You may pick one envelope and keep the money it contains. Having chosen an envelope, you are given the chance to switch. Your friend argues that it is always beneficial to switch: "the other envelope contains 2A with probability 1/2 and A/2 with probability 1/2, so the expected value of the other envelope is: (1/2)(2A) + (1/2)(A/2) = (5/4)A." What is wrong with this argument?  


#### Medium

1. [King and Poison](https://medium.com/i-math/a-king-1000-bottles-of-wine-10-prisoners-and-a-drop-of-poison-2dd1959a8dd2)
> The King invites 1000 senators to his party, and each senator brings a bottle of wine. Soon after, the King discovers that one was poisoned. However, the King has 10 prisoners whom he decides can help him determine which bottle contains the poison. The poison has no effect on the prisoner until exactly 24 hours later, when the infected prisoner suddenly dies. The King needs to determine which bottle of wine is poisoned by tomorrow, and hence only has time for one round of testing. How can the King administer the wine to the prisoners to ensure that 24 hours from now, he is guaranteed to have found the poisoned wine bottle?

2. [100 Airplane Seats](https://medium.com/i-math/solving-an-advanced-probability-problem-with-virtually-no-math-5750707885f1)  
> 100 passengers board an airplane with exactly 100 seats. Everyone has a ticket with an assigned seat number. However, the first passenger has lost their ticket and takes a random seat. Every subsequent passenger attempts to choose their own seat, but takes a random seat if theirâ€™s is taken. Suppose you are the very last passenger to board the plane. What is the probability that you will get your assigned seat?


#### Hard

1. [100 Pirates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pirate_game)  
> 100 pirates discover a chest containing 100 gold coins, and need to divvy it up. The pirates are ranked based on seniority (Pirate 1 to Pirate n, where Pirate n is the most senior). The most senior pirate gets to propose a plan and then all the pirates vote on it. If at least half agree on the plan, the proposal passes. Otherwise, he is thrown off the ship and the next most senior pirate makes a proposal. The first priority of the pirates is to stay alive and the second is to maximize their take. The pirates are all rational, greedy, and perfect logicians. What plan can pirate n devise to win maximize his gold while winning enough votes? 

2. [201 Islanders](https://xkcd.com/solution.html) 
> There are 201 people on an island. 100 of them have blue eyes, 100 have brown eyes, and 1 has green eyes (the Guru). No one knows the color of their own eyes. Every night, a ferry stops at the island. Any islanders who have figured out the color of their own eyes will leave the island, and the rest stay. Everyone can see everyone else at all times and keeps a count of the number of people they see with each eye color (excluding themselves), but they cannot otherwise communicate. Once per day, the Guru tells them whether she sees at least one person with blue eyes. All islanders are perfect logicians. Everyone on the island knows all the rules in this paragraph. Who leaves the island, and on what night? 


#### Super Hard

1. [100 Prisoners](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_prisoners_problem): 
> The prison warden offers 100 death row prisoners, who are numbered from 1 to 100, a last chance. A room contains a cupboard with 100 drawers. The warden randomly puts one prisoner's number in each closed drawer. The prisoners enter the room, one after another. Each prisoner may open and look into 50/100 drawers, in any order. The drawers are closed again afterwards. If, during this search, every prisoner finds his number, all prisoners are pardoned. Otherwise, all prisoners die. The prisoners may discuss strategy before the game begins. What is the prisoners' best strategy? 

2. [Partial Credit](https://terrytao.wordpress.com/2016/06/01/how-to-assign-partial-credit-on-an-exam-of-true-false-questions/)
> On a true-false test with n questions, every question must be answered with a subjective probability that it is correct. What reward functions f(p) can incentivize students to always report their true beliefs? Normalize f(p) such that f(1) = 1 and f(0.5) = 0.
