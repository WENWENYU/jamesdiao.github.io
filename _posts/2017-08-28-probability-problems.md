This is a compilation of some of my favorite problems from probability and statistics. Some can be done with a bit of intuition, but most require math. When you're ready, click on the title for an answer and explanation. (If you liked these, check out <a href="/archives/2017/08/28/logic-puzzles">my general logic puzzles</a>!)

### Easy

1. [St. Petersburg Lottery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Petersburg_paradox)<a name="StPetersburgLottery"></a>  
> This casino game involves flips of a fair coin. The pot starts with 2 cents. The player will continue flipping the coin until it lands tails. Every time the coin lands heads, the pot doubles; otherwise, the player keeps the money in the pot and the game ends. Altogether, the player wins 2k dollars, where k is the number of tosses. What's a fair price for entering the game? 

2. [Two Envelopes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two_envelopes_problem)<a name="TwoEnvelopes"></a>  
> You are given two envelopes with money; one contains twice as much as the other. You may pick one envelope and keep the money it contains. Having chosen an envelope, you are given the chance to switch. Your friend argues that it is always beneficial to switch: "the other envelope contains 2A with probability 1/2 and A/2 with probability 1/2, so the expected value of the other envelope is: (1/2)(2A) + (1/2)(A/2) = (5/4)A." What is wrong with this argument?

### Medium
1. [Bus Wait Time](http://estebanmoro.org/2009/01/waiting-for-the-bus/)<a name="BusWaitTime"></a>  
> Buses arrive at the bus stop every 15 minutes on the dot. You arrive to the stop at a random time (uniformly distributed). How long will you have to wait until the next bus shows up? What if the time is Poisson-distributed with a mean wait time of 15 minutes? Bonus: What if it the time has an arbitrary distribution, the mean wait time is still 15 minutes, and the variance is known? (needs math)

2. [Coupon Collector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coupon_collector%27s_problem)<a name="CouponCollector"></a>  
> Given n coupons, how many coupons do you expect to draw with replacement before having drawn each coupon at least once? (needs math)

3. [Amoebas Revisited](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/4768/amoeba-interview-question)<a name="AmoebasRevisited"></a>
> You place a single amoeba into a jar with infinite space and nutrients. After 3 minutes, that amoeba will either die, persist, or divide with equal probability. In other words, it is equally likely to be replaced by 0, 1, or 2 amoeba in the next generation. What is the probability that the entire population eventually dies out? Bonus: what if it can also divide into 3 offspring? (needs math)

### Hard

1. [100 Prisoners](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_prisoners_problem)<a name="100Prisoners"></a>
> The prison warden offers 100 death row prisoners, who are numbered from 1 to 100, a last chance. A room contains a cupboard with 100 drawers. The warden randomly puts one prisoner's number in each closed drawer. The prisoners enter the room, one after another. Each prisoner may open and look into 50/100 drawers, in any order. The drawers are closed again afterwards. If, during this search, every prisoner finds his number, all prisoners are pardoned. Otherwise, all prisoners die. The prisoners may discuss strategy before the game begins. What is the prisoners' best strategy? (needs a lot of math to determine the actual probability, but not to find the strategy)
